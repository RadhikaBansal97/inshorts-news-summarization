"Pakistan legend Wasim Akram has responded to comments by former Indian cricketer Gautam Gambhir, terming Babar Azam a selfish captain. Without supporting or opposing Gambhir’s views, Akram took a neutral stand and stated that everyone is entitled to have an opinion.

While on commentary during the Pakistan-Netherlands game in the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022, Gambhir hit out at Babar over his reluctance to move down the batting order despite his struggles with the willow.

Ad

During an interaction on A Sports, a viewer asked Akram for his views on Gambhir being critical of Babar’s leadership. The former left-arm pacer commented:

“That’s his opinion. Gautam Gambhir, himself being a successful captain in IPL, winning twice for KKR… Of course, he is one of the top players of his time. Everybody, I suppose, has a right to give their opinion. And that’s his opinion.”

While terming Babar as a selfish leader during the Pakistan-Netherlands game, Gambhir said:

""In my opinion, first, you think about your team instead of yourself; if nothing goes according to your plan, you should have sent Fakhar Zaman up the batting order. This is called selfishness; as a captain, it is easy to be selfish.

Ad

""It is easy for Babar and Rizwan to open the innings for Pakistan and create so many records. If you want to be a leader, you have to think about your team,"" Gambhir added.

The Pakistan captain and opening batter has been in the line of fire owing to his poor form. In three Super 12 matches so far, he has registered scores of 0, 4 and 4.

Pakistan’s hopes of qualification for the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup are hanging by a thread. They are placed fifth in Group 2, following losses to India and Zimbabwe. They beat the Netherlands by six wickets in their previous match to keep their hopes alive.

Amid all the criticism over his lack of runs in the T20 World Cup, Babar has found support from South African legend AB de Villiers. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the former Proteas captain hailed the Pakistan cricketer and said:

""Babar Azam is an amazing player. I watched him play for the first time, saying this boy can play. He is a fantastic addition to Pakistan's success, and it's great to see young generations taking ownership.”

“I appeal to people if possible work from home and avoid taking out private vehicles. 50 per cent of the pollution is from vehicles. People shouldn't burst crackers,” Rai said.

Rai also said the BJP should stop abusing farmers for stubble burning, alleging the party hates farmers because of their anti-farm law protests.

“Farmers are forced to burn stubble in Punjab because the BJP-led Centre did not support the state government's plan to provide a cash incentive to them for not burning the crop residue,” Rai said.

“The BJP is now seeking registration of FIR against farmers. Do not seek revenge, start supporting them,” the minister added.

Rai said the air pollution problem cannot be resolved through politics. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has come up with a plan, which will have to be implemented in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana too - in Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Gurugram and Bahadurgarh.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Russian security services have detained a Ukrainian citizen on suspicion of planning to ""sabotage"" a power line in Crimea, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Wednesday.

The FSB said a man in his 40s had been found carrying diagrams of power lines, three explosive devices and instructions on how to use them, and suspected the man had been recruited by Ukrainian intelligence.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) was not immediately available to comment.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine over eight months ago, Moscow has repeatedly accused what it calls Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" of targeting its energy infrastructure, including in August when it blamed Ukraine for damaging an electricity substation in Russian-annexed Crimea.

Ukraine did not claim involvement but officials have welcomed previous incidents, calling them ""payback"" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
